    This command allows you to order a series of rovers. For each rover, you must provide its initial position and a series of instructions.

    The initial position is composed of two integers and a cardinal letter. The integers represent the x and y coordinates of the rover. The cardinal letter represents the direction the rover is facing. The possible cardinal letters are: N (north), S (south), E (east) and W (west).

    The instructions are a series of letters. Each letter corresponds to an instruction. The possible instructions are: M (move forward), L (turn left) and R (turn right).'

For instance, to order 2 rovers, you would write:
    node dist/bin/console "1 2 N
LMLMLMLMM
3 3 E
MMRMMR"
